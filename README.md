#Learning gradle by trying examples


This project contains a lot of examples of gradle. Each example is made in such a way that minimum possible code is written so we can focus on learning only a particular topic. And some projects require that you have already tried/learned stuffs in other projects, for those you will find all the instructions in the README.md file. 

Each single project has a `README.md` file that contains description of the project.


Happy gradle learning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
